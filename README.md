**Emerging Technologies in Education - LET UniOulu**

Laura Giovenardi Goretti

Application developed through vibe-coding to teach currents and global marine ecossystems through a magic bubble, creativity, and AI-generated responses to the player's questions. The intended audience is children 7-10 years old. There is still a lot to be improved, but the basics are there :)
